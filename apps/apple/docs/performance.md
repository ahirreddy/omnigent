# Mac app performance

How to load the app with a lot of data, measure it, and what the last pass found. Numbers are
for the Debug build (what `just apple-build` makes), on an Apple silicon Mac shared with other
builds, so wall-clock times are noisy; main-thread CPU time and sample shares are steadier.

## Seed a large data set

With the local services running (`just apple-services start`, the mock LLM and the `mock-model`
agent, see [verify-real-app.md](verify-real-app.md)):

```sh
just apple-seed-large
# From a worktree whose server runs from another checkout:
just apple-seed-large --runtime <checkout>/.native-lab-server
```

It stores, without model calls, 320 short sessions spread over 60 days in six projects (every
fifth unfiled) and three long transcripts ("Perf long transcript 1-3", 500, 650 and 800 turns)
with code blocks, tables, task lists, KaTeX, Mermaid, reasoning and tool calls. The long ones use
the `mock-model` agent on the online host, so sending a message streams a reply into them. Ids are
fixed: reruns add nothing and the earlier fixtures are left alone. `--sessions`, `--long` and
`--long-turns` change the sizes. Tests: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest apps/apple/Tools/test_seed_large_fixtures.py`.

## Measure scenarios in the app

`just apple-perf` (`Tools/perf/perf.py`) launches the build you name by path (never by bundle
id), injects a main-thread hitch monitor (`hitch-monitor.c`, a background thread that pings the
main queue every 4 ms and logs every wait of 12 ms or more) and needs no Accessibility permission.

```sh
app=apps/apple/build/DerivedData/Build/Products/Debug/Omnigent.app
just apple-perf suite --app "$app" --runs 3   # launch, open, switch, stream; prints medians
just apple-perf launch --app "$app" [<session-id>]
just apple-perf open --app "$app" <session-id> [--sample 6]
just apple-perf stream --app "$app" <session-id> --seconds 12 [--sample 1]
just apple-perf shot --app "$app" /tmp/window.png
```

- `launch` quits the app, writes a saved-tabs file with one New Tab (so every launch starts the
  same), starts it with `-ApplePersistenceIgnoreState YES` and reports time to the first window,
  time until the main thread is quiet for a second, and main-thread CPU.
- `open` deep-links a session; `suite` opens long transcript 1, then 2, then switches back to 1.
- `stream` posts a message to the session (the mock model streams its canned reply) and reports
  main-thread CPU, hitches (waits of 33 ms or more), hangs (100 ms or more) and blocked time.
- `--sample` also runs `sample` and prints the main thread's on-CPU share; the report is in
  `$TMPDIR/omnigent-perf`. Sampling suspends the app briefly, so take hitch counts from runs
  without it. Read the main thread's call tree in the report, or `sample <pid> 5` by hand, to
  see where the time goes; `Self._printChanges()` in a view body shows why it re-rendered.

Typing in the composer, scrolling and opening the right panel need synthetic input, which needs
Accessibility permission; they are covered by the package benchmarks below instead.

## Package benchmarks

Hot pure functions on seeded-like data, printed by tests that run only with `OMNIGENT_BENCH=1`:

```sh
cd apps/apple
OMNIGENT_BENCH=1 swift test --package-path Packages/OmnigentUI --filter TranscriptBenchmarks
OMNIGENT_BENCH=1 swift test --package-path Packages/OmnigentAppUI --filter SidebarBenchmarks
OMNIGENT_BENCH=1 swift test --package-path Packages/OmnigentUI --filter StreamingMarkdownTests/benchmark
```

## Results (November 2026)

| Scenario (Debug) | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Transcript layout per streamed delta, 400 / 2,000 / 4,000 rows | 2.7 / 14.4 / 39.9 ms | 0.8 / 4.2 / 10.5 ms |
| A session-list server row, 650 sessions (unchanged / changed row) | 41 / 41 ms | 0.4 / 32 ms |
| Sidebar state on a shell redraw, 650 sessions | 57-75 ms | 0.03 ms (memo hit) |
| Hosting views re-measuring the conversation, share of main-thread samples while streaming into a long session | 17-20% | under 1% |
| Markdown parse, 1.8 KB answer, uncached | 3.8-8.7 ms | unchanged |
| Highlight a 100-line Swift block (cached afterwards) | 5 ms tokenize + 4 ms color | unchanged |

App scenarios (`just apple-perf suite --runs 3`, medians; the machine's load average was 500-900,
so differences under about 30% are noise):

| Scenario, two rounds of 3 runs | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Launch: first window | 1.3 s / 0.7 s | 1.3 s / 1.0 s |
| Launch: main-thread CPU until quiet | 2.1 s / 1.6 s | 1.9 s / 1.7 s |
| Open a 500-turn transcript: main-thread CPU | 3.3 s / 2.7 s | 3.2 s / 2.7 s |
| Switch back to its tab: main-thread CPU | 1.4 s / 1.3 s | 1.5 s / 1.4 s |
| Stream a reply into it for 12 s: main-thread CPU | 4.8 s / 4.4 s | 4.5 s / 3.7 s |
| Stream: blocked time in waits of 33 ms or more | 4.7 s / 3.0 s | 3.9 s / 2.5 s |

The first "after" round predates the right-panel fix below. Opening and switching are dominated
by SwiftUI and AppKit building the tab's views, which this pass did not change.

What changed:

- The detail column (NavigationSplitView) and the conversation beside the right panel
  (`.inspector`) are each hosted in their own `NSHostingController`, which measured the whole
  conversation for its minimum size after every update. Both roots now answer from a fixed
  minimum (`unmeasuredMinimum`, Mac only), as the window root does with `WindowMinimumSize`.
- `SessionListStore` skips unchanged server rows, calls the core for attention only for changed
  sessions and assigns only changed values, so the sidebar, tab strip, menu bar and Dock no longer
  redraw for every row.
- The window shell keeps the sidebar's state in `SidebarStateMemo`, and the tab strip's tooltip
  reads only what the status line shows, so the shell no longer rebuilds the sidebar for turn
  timer, link or history-paging changes.
- `TranscriptLayoutMemo` reuses the folded turns before the last user message and folds only the
  open turn for each streamed delta.

## Where the time still goes

- Opening a long session costs about 3 s of main-thread CPU in Debug and switching back to its
  tab about 1.5 s: the tab's content is rebuilt and SwiftUI lays out the transcript's lazy rows
  (environment lookups, text layout and the selectable-text overlays dominate the samples; app
  code is under 2%). Keeping recently used tabs alive, or fewer views per markdown block, are the
  next levers.
- Streaming into a long session uses 30-40% of the main thread in Debug: each delta re-renders the
  transcript body (only the streaming row's views change) and its markdown block views.
- A changed session-list row still sends every session through the core twice (filter and
  totals), about 30 ms with 650 sessions; an incremental filter in the core would remove it.
- Debug is several times slower than Release for this generic SwiftUI and value-type code;
  measure a Release build (`xcodebuild -configuration Release`) before chasing a Debug-only
  cost.

## iOS and iPadOS

Measured on the iPhone 17 and iPad Air 11-inch (M4) simulators (iOS 27.2) with Release
(`-configuration Release`) and Debug builds against the large seed (about 650 sessions) while the
machine's load average was 300-900, so treat single numbers as rough.

### How to measure

- Process CPU over a window: `ps -o cputime= -p <pid>` before and after (no sampling overhead);
  the app's pid is `pgrep -f "<udid>.*Omnigent.app/Omnigent"`.
- Where the main thread goes: `sample <pid> 5`. Sampling during launch makes dyld wait on the
  sampler, so sample from a second or two after launch.
- Open a session at launch without input: write the app's saved tabs file
  (`Library/Application Support/<bundle id>/Tabs/*.json` in the app's data container, see
  `TabPersistence`) with one chat tab selected, then `xcrun simctl launch`.
- Time the connect: point `omnigent.lastServer` at a logging TCP proxy in front of
  `127.0.0.1:6767` and read the request times.
- Why a view re-rendered: `let _ = Self._printChanges()` in its body and
  `xcrun simctl launch --console-pty`.

### Results (November 2026)

| Scenario | Device, build | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cold launch, New Tab restored: first request / signed in, list shown | iPhone Release | 3.5 s / 3.5-4.2 s |
| Same, fresh install | iPad Debug and Release | 3.6 s / 4.6-5 s |
| Connect itself (`/.well-known` through `/v1/me`, list and updates socket) | both | under 0.2 s |
| Cold launch, a conversation tab restored | iPhone Release | main thread at 100% indefinitely; the screen stays on "Connecting…" because frames stop committing |
| Same | iPad Debug | 1.3-1.5 CPU s per second for 10-30 s; follow-up requests (agent, pull requests, skills) leave 10-30 s late |
| Idle on the session list | both | 0.0% |
| A reply streaming in another session, list shown | iPhone Release | 2.4% CPU, 3 shell redraws |
| Streaming into a 160-item transcript, then idle | iPhone Release* | 9-14% CPU, then 0.0-0.2% |
| Sidebar state rebuild, 650 sessions (`SidebarBenchmarks`) | Mac Debug | 78 ms → 21 ms |
| Typing 20 characters | iPhone Release* | the conversation container and screen re-render about 14 times |

\* With the navigation bar items removed locally, to get past the loop below.

The first 3.5 s of a launch is the simulator loading the app (dyld) before any app code runs;
the connect is fast. The slow sign-in seen on iPad mini and the folded Duo ("about 50 s") is
the conversation re-render loop starving the main actor while a restored chat tab builds, not
the network.

What changed for iOS:

- `SessionListStore`, `ConnectionStore` and `ConversationStore` set observable properties only
  when the value changes (connection phase, updates link, unread set, link and hydration
  state), so a resent server row or status redraws nothing.
- The sidebar no longer counts All and Archived through two `filterSessions` calls over every
  session on each rebuild; nothing showed those counts.

### Where the time still goes

- **The conversation's toolbar loop (P0).** With a conversation open, `ConversationScreen`
  re-renders, re-vends its navigation bar items, the bar's hosting controllers update traits
  and environment, and that re-renders `ConversationScreen` again
  (`ToolbarBridge.preferencesDidChange` in every sample). The screen's `draft`, `mode` and
  `fork` closure bindings make every pass count as a change. Reading `transcriptTitleMenu` as
  `@Entry` values or not at all, or passing key-path bindings, did not stop it; removing the
  navigation title, title menu and toolbar items did.
- **Typing.** SwiftUI reads the draft binding while updating `ConversationScreen`'s inputs, so
  the container tracks the composer's text and each keystroke re-renders the whole screen
  (transcript wrapper, right panel, toolbar). Not reading the draft in the screen's body is not
  enough; the draft has to reach the composer without passing through the screen's inputs.
- Not measured here: rotating the iPad, split widths and keyboard show and hide (no input
  access to the iPad simulator in this pass), and the transcript showing under the dock while
  the iPhone layout settles.
